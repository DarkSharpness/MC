\section{Problem 2}

\subsection*{(a)}

$$
\varphi = (\Diamond \square a) \wedge (\square \Diamond b)
$$

Sketch of proof:

1. $\mathcal{L}_w(\mathcal{G}) \subseteq \text{Word}(\varphi)$

First of all, it's trivial to see that the GBNA can't reach $q_3$, because if so,
we will never be able to reach $q_2$, which means that we can't visit the one of the final
set $\{q_2\}$ infinitely often.

Then, it's trivial to see that the GBNA will eventually reach $q_1$, and then $a$ must hold true,
which is the $\Diamond \square a$ part.
Moreover, it's also trivial to see that after the GBNA reaches $q_1$, $q_2$ will be visited infinitely often,
which means that $b$ will hold true infinitely often, which is the $\square \Diamond b$ part.

2. $\text{Word}(\varphi) \subseteq \mathcal{L}_w(\mathcal{G})$

For each state that satisfies $\varphi$, for any trace $\sigma=A_0 A_1 A_2 \cdots \in \text{Word}(\varphi)$,
suppose that $\{a\} \subseteq A_i$ when $i \geq n$, then we can construct a path in the GBNA that stays at
$q_0$ and travel to $q_1$ at the $n$-th input. Then since $\{a\} \subseteq A_i$ when $i \geq n$, and we have
$\square \Diamond b$ (which implies infinitely often $b$), we can construct a path that stays at $q_1$ and
travel to $q_2$ from $q_1$ once $b$ holds true, and travels back to $q_1$ immediately after that.
This way, we can construct a path that satisfies $\varphi$ in the GBNA.

To sum up, $\mathcal{L}_w(\mathcal{G}) = \text{Word}(\varphi)$.
